# Event-Driven Architecture Design with NestJS Backend (Test-Driven Approach)

## 1. Overall Architecture
- Angular Frontend
- NestJS Backend
- WebSocket communication for real-time events
- Central database for player data storage (SQLite or hosted database)

## 2. NestJS Backend Structure and Testing
For each module, service, and controller, follow these steps:
- Write unit tests
- Implement the feature to pass the tests
- Write integration tests
- Implement the integration to pass the tests

### Modules:
- GameModule
- PlayerModule
- EventsModule
- DatabaseModule (new)

### Services:
- GameStateService
- PlayerService
- EventGateway
- DatabaseService (new)

### Controllers:
- GameController
- PlayerController

## 3. Event Types and Testing
- Define event interfaces and write unit tests for each event type
- Implement the following event types to pass the tests:
  - PlayerAction: Events initiated by players
  - GameStateUpdate: Events sent from server to update game state
  - SystemEvent: Events for game system updates (e.g., timer events)

## 4. WebSocket Integration and Testing
- Write unit and integration tests for WebSocket functionality
- Implement WebSocket Gateway in NestJS to pass the tests
- Use Socket.io for real-time bidirectional communication
- Write end-to-end tests for WebSocket communication

## 5. Event Flow and Testing
Write unit and integration tests for each step of the event flow:

1. Player Action:
   - Test: Angular component emits event
   - Test: Angular service sends event to NestJS backend via WebSocket
   - Test: NestJS processes event and updates game state
   - Test: NestJS broadcasts updated state to all players

2. Game State Update:
   - Test: NestJS sends state updates to all connected clients
   - Test: Angular receives update and reflects changes in UI

3. System Events:
   - Test: NestJS generates system events (e.g., timer updates)
   - Test: Events are broadcast to all players
   - Test: Angular components react to system events

Implement the event flow to pass all tests.

## 6. State Management and Testing
- Write unit tests for state management in both frontend and backend
- Implement state management on both frontend and backend to pass tests
- Use RxJS on Angular for reactive state management
- Implement and test state persistence on NestJS backend

## 7. Player Management and Data Storage
- Write unit and integration tests for player authentication and authorization
- Implement player authentication and authorization to pass tests
- Write tests for player session management
- Implement player session management to pass tests
- Write tests for multi-player game room creation and management
- Implement multi-player game room features to pass tests
- Write tests for player data storage (email and name) in the central database
- Implement player data storage functionality to pass tests

## 8. Scalability Considerations and Testing
- Write performance tests to establish scalability benchmarks
- Implement horizontal scaling for NestJS backend
- Write tests for message queue integration
- Consider implementing a message queue for event processing based on test results
- Write tests for caching strategies
- Implement caching strategies for game state based on test results

## 9. Error Handling, Recovery, and Testing
- Write unit and integration tests for error scenarios
- Implement error handling for network issues to pass tests
- Write tests for reconnection logic
- Design and implement reconnection logic for dropped connections
- Write tests for game state recovery mechanisms
- Implement game state recovery mechanisms to pass tests

## 10. End-to-End Testing
- Develop comprehensive end-to-end tests covering:
  - Complete game scenarios
  - Player registration and data storage
  - Multi-player interactions
  - Error recovery scenarios

## 11. Performance Testing
- Set up performance testing tools
- Write performance tests for critical parts of the application
- Optimize the application to meet performance benchmarks

## 12. Monitoring, Logging, and Testing
- Write unit tests for logging functionality
- Implement logging for all events to pass tests
- Set up monitoring for backend performance and WebSocket connections
- Write integration tests for analytics
- Implement analytics for game events and player actions to pass tests

## 13. Continuous Integration and Deployment
- Set up CI/CD pipeline to run all tests before deployment
- Implement automated deployment process
- Write smoke tests to verify successful deployment

## 14. Documentation
- Document the test-driven approach and testing strategy
- Create documentation for setting up the development and testing environment
- Document any known issues, limitations, and future improvements

Throughout the development process, maintain a high level of test coverage and continuously run tests to ensure that new changes don't break existing functionality. This test-driven approach will help ensure the reliability, scalability, and maintainability of the event-driven architecture with NestJS backend.
