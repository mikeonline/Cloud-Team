# Migration Plan to Angular (Test-Driven Approach)

## 1. Project Setup and Testing Environment
- Create a new Angular project using Angular CLI
- Set up the project structure
- Configure testing frameworks (Jasmine and Karma)
- Set up end-to-end testing environment (Protractor or Cypress)

## 2. Component Structure and Unit Tests
For each component, follow these steps:
- Write unit tests for the component
- Implement the component to pass the tests
- Components to create:
  - GameComponent (main game container)
  - TimerComponent
  - ControlPanelComponent
  - MessagePanelComponent
  - ScorePanelComponent
  - PlayerRegistrationComponent (for player data storage)
  - ObservationLoungeComponent (new, for watching the game)

## 3. Services and Unit Tests
For each service, follow these steps:
- Write unit tests for the service
- Implement the service to pass the tests
- Services to create:
  - GameStateService (manages overall game state)
  - TimerService
  - ScoreService
  - MessageService
  - PlayerService (for player data operations)
  - ObservationService (new, for managing observers)

## 4. Data Models and Unit Tests
- Define interfaces for game objects and states
- Create Player interface with email and name properties
- Create Observer interface for users watching the game
- Write unit tests for any complex data transformations or validations
- Implement the models and transformations to pass the tests

## 5. Integration Tests
- Write integration tests for component interactions
- Implement component integration to pass the tests
- Write tests for integration between game and observation lounge

## 6. Styling and Visual Regression Tests
- Migrate existing CSS to Angular component styles
- Implement Tailwind CSS in the Angular project
- Design and implement styles for the observation lounge
- Set up visual regression testing (e.g., using Storybook and Chromatic)

## 7. Asset Management
- Move existing assets to the Angular assets folder
- Update asset references in the Angular components
- Add any new assets required for the observation lounge
- Write tests to ensure assets are correctly loaded and displayed

## 8. Game Logic Migration
- Write unit tests for game logic based on the existing game.js
- Convert game.js to TypeScript, implementing the logic to pass the tests
- Refactor game logic into appropriate services and components
- Implement Angular's event emitters for local event handling
- Write additional tests for the refactored and event-driven structure
- Implement logic to broadcast game state to observers

## 9. Player Registration and Data Storage
- Write unit tests for PlayerRegistrationComponent and PlayerService
- Implement player registration form and service to pass the tests
- Write integration tests for storing player data in the central database
- Implement the integration with the backend API for player data storage

## 10. Observation Lounge Implementation
- Write unit tests for ObservationLoungeComponent and ObservationService
- Implement the observation lounge functionality to pass the tests
- Write integration tests for connecting observers to the game
- Implement real-time updates for observers

## 11. Single Game Hosting
- Modify GameStateService to manage a single game instance
- Write tests to ensure only one game can be active at a time
- Implement logic to handle game creation, joining, and observation

## 12. End-to-End Testing
- Write end-to-end tests for critical user flows, including:
  - Game play scenarios
  - Player registration and data storage
  - Timer and scoring functionality
  - Joining the observation lounge and watching a game
- Implement any necessary changes to pass the end-to-end tests

## 13. Performance Testing
- Set up performance testing tools (e.g., Lighthouse, WebPageTest)
- Write performance tests for critical parts of the application
- Optimize the application to meet performance benchmarks
- Test performance with multiple observers in the lounge

## 14. Build and Deployment
- Configure the Angular build process
- Set up continuous integration to run all tests before deployment
- Set up deployment pipeline for the Angular frontend
- Write smoke tests to verify successful deployment

## 15. Documentation
- Document the test-driven approach and testing strategy
- Create documentation for setting up the development environment, including testing tools
- Document the observation lounge feature and how to use it
- Document any known issues, limitations, and future improvements

Throughout the migration process, maintain a high level of test coverage and continuously run tests to ensure that new changes don't break existing functionality. This test-driven approach will help ensure the reliability and maintainability of the migrated Angular application, including the new observation lounge feature.
